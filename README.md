This is a news aggregator web app I made for my portfolio.
It uses **React** on the front-end and **Express and MongoDB** on the back-end.

## Installation

clone this repo and run `npm install`

and then create a `.env` file inside the root directory to define your own environment variables.

    NEWS_API_KEY=<api key from newsapi.org>
    JWT_SECRET=<your secret>
    MONGO_URL=<your mongodb url>

Run `npm start` to run

Have fun!
